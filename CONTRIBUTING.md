# Contributing to this project

This project is publicly licensed and will have a public home project on
https://www.gitlab.com/tychosoft. This will an issue tracker where people can
submit public bug reports, and a public git repo. All project documentation
will also be found either in a project wiki or in the projects repo.

## CI Integration

Gitlab is used for public ci integration. Since the most common deployment
platform I use is AlpineLinux, ci defaults to this. Alpine also minimizes ci
processing overhead.

There are only a few types of ci jobs I may use. One is to evaluate merge
requests, and if this is broken hopefully whomever submits a merge request can
fix it. The other I may add is for public things that need to be done for a new
tagged release.

## Documentation

I am striving to make all project documentation viewable either thru each
projects wiki pages or directly in the repo. Product documentation in the
repo will also be in distribution tarballs. The wiki will be used for
projects that have graphical images for documentation.

## Issues

The gitlab support ticket system can be used for bug requests, discussion
items, or any other kind of inquiry at all. It's contents are fully public.

## Code of Conduct

Be excellent to each other.

Don't be the asshole.
