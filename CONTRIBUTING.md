# Contributing to this project

This project is publicly licensed and will have a public home project on
www.tychosoft.com/tychosoft. This will an issue tracker where people can submit
public bug reports, and a wiki for hosting project documentation. I am not
maintaining a public git repo nor do I generally have production or development
related resources hosted on external sites.

Given that I may be without connectivity at times, sites I have used for
hosting have been down at times, and one site was confiscated, this seemed
easier, especially given lack of participation. Some overhead and complexity is
needed to structure repos and perform workflows that also include public
participation. The only other means of public contact for now is thru email
using tychosoft@gmail.com.

## Documentation

I am striving to make all project documentation viewable thru each projects
wiki tab. I also hope to consolidate any non-graphical Wiki documentation back
into the distribution tarball.

## Issues

The support ticket system can be used for bug requests, discussion items, or
any kind of inquiry at all. It's contents are fully public. It also is entirely
separate from my internal development ticketing.

## Patches

Patches may be submitted and attached to an issue in the issue tracker or sent
by email. They should be provided in unified diffs. All code contributions must
be held in copyright under Tycho Softworks for now, which may require a
copyright assignment form. This is a new requirement since all current code
already is exclusively copyrighted by Tycho Softworks as it had only been
worked on by me alone, but this may change if there is active participation.
